Changes in CodeMelon v1.1.0 (indev):
1. (Major) Added support for variables :
    Use the var keyword to assign values to variables.
    Variable names can contain A-Z, 0-9 and _
    var keyword is case sensitive
    variables can be assigned during operations, but they must be inside parentheses. For example: 5 + (var x = 10) will output 15.
    Syntax: var variable_name = value (type <int>)
    • Only supports type <int> as of now.
    • Errors generated by 'var' will be grouped under Syntax Errors.

2. (Medium) Updated error messages to include keyword 'var'

3. (Minor) Updated Shell to change version.

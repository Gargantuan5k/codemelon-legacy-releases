Changelog for major update v0.4.0

1. Added support for FOR and WHILE loops
    • FOR loops:
        Syntax:
        for <cond1> to <cond2> step <stepCount> then <expr>
    • WHILE loops:
        Syntax:
        while <condition> then <expr>

2. Added the STRING datatype
    Defined using '' or ""
    Can be any ascii character
    Can be assigned to variables and lists using the correct keywords.

3. Added lists
    Defined using square brackets []
    Can contain INT or STRING datatypes
    Lists support appension, concatenation, returning and deleting.
        • Append using the '+' character. Example: [1, 2, 3] + 4 will return [1, 2, 3, 4]
        •  Remove/delete using the '-' character followed by the index of the item. Example: [1, 2, 3] - 0 will return [2, 3].
        • Concatenate using the '*' character followed by another list. Example: [1, 2, 3] * [4, 5, 6] will return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
        • Use the '/' character followed by item index to return an item from the list (without deleting it). Example: [1, 2, 3] / 0 will return 1.
        • Use '-' after '/' to remove and return an item. (NOTE: Will add pop() builtin function to do this)
        • FOR and WHILE loops can now return lists. Example: for i = 1 to 11 then i ^ 2 will return a list of the squares of all numbers from 1 to 10.

4. (Minor) Made small changes to the Shell
